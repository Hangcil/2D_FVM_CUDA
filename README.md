# 2D_FVM_CUDA
2D FVM solvers for the Euler equations parallelized by CUDA. This lib implements my own algorithm proposed in my academic paper. It's fast and reliable, which has implemented our algorithm faithfully and correctly. The following test is conducted on RTX 4060, finishing in 15 minutes for a 2000Ã—2000 mesh size.
